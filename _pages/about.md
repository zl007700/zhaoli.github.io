About Me
AI researcher and algorithm engineer building intelligent financial systems at Stepfun. Expertise in LLMs and multi-agent architectures for automated decision-making.

Research Focus
My primary domains include Large Language Models (LLMs) in financial applications and multi-agent system architectures for decision automation. My methodological expertise covers fine-tuning transformer-based models, designing agent coordination mechanisms for constrained environments, and applying deep learning to financial time-series analysis.

Technical Proficiencies
Core competencies: LLM adaptation for domain-specific tasks, distributed agent system design, and financial risk modeling frameworks.

Technical toolset: 
Python (proficient), SQL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP, QuantLib, RiskMetrics, and Bloomberg API.
